Adjustable Robust Optimal Operation of Water Distribution Systems

This is a MATLAB version of the ARO-WDS.<br>
It is not completed and several problems were obtained.<br>
Use on your own responsibility

RSOME ([Chen, Sim, and Xiong. 2020](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2020.3603)) is a matlab toolkit for Robust Optimization<br>
It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.rsomerso.com/) and it need to be added to MATLAB path, see example in `main.m`<br>

The model is based on Gurobi solver but other solvers should be able to handle is as well
